        <div class="AboutUs-founder-content">
          <p>
            The Clever Accountants founder, Gustavo Velazquez, at the age of 12,
            arrived in the United States from Mexico in summer 1998.
          </p>
          <p>
            A year after high school, he worked at Bank of America as a personal
            banker. He loved hearing customers talk about their businesses.
            Despite his youth, he advised and coached his business owner
            customers. As a result, his business owner customers earned their
            confidence and trust in him. He realized that being an entrepreneur
            was his passion.
          </p>
          <p>
            He always felt like he wanted to do things differently from everyone
            else. In 2008, at the age of 22, he started a logistics company. In
            his first year, he faced many obstacles to establish his business,
            including the unexpected economic crisis. Even though the company
            could`ve grown in 2012, it fell through because new state law
            required him to change its operation.
          </p>
          <p>
            He didnâ€™t lose hope, so he knew it was time to take a step back to
            restructure and plan his next move. Gustavo was eager to learn more
            about the business world and continued studying it at California
            State University, Fullerton. He was fully committed to earning a
            degree in Business Administration. It was a matter of time before he
            started his next business venture.
          </p>
          <p>
            In January of 2014, Gustavo established a business consulting
            company. He spent months analyzing the industry to create the
            perfect business model. He later realized he got to the phase of
            Analysis Paralysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The turning point that brought him back into the game was seeing his
            first daughter born on Christmas day 2015. He spent months looking
            for his first client, tirelessly making cold calls until he landed
            upon a national non-profit organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, this was the beginning of his career as an accountant and
            strategic business mentor.
